            <p>Originating from the planet Mandalore in the Outer Rim, the Mandalorians' history was one of warriors, who would become feared throughout the galaxy, gaining reputation as mercenaries and bounty hunters. Even prior to the formation of the Old Republic, war dominated their way of life.
            This life of war eventually turned to dreams of expansion and a group of Mandalorian warriors known as the crusaders began waging war against other people to conquer their worlds. Armour-clad and wielding swords, the crusaders lay waste to many worlds during their wars. Such wars were depicted constantly in the art of the later Mandalorians, on murals in the Mandalorian capital of Sundari as well as the moon-province of Concordia. The crusaders conquered several worlds and systems beyond their own, such as Krownest and Concord Dawn. This world would bare the scars of hundreds of years of Mandalorian wars, as almost a third of its planetary mass was fractured and reduced to space rubble. These early conquests would remain part of the Mandalore sector during the later years of the Galactic Republic and into the reign of the Galactic Empire.</p>
        
            <p>The Mandalorian crusaders' expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the Jedi Order and the Old Republic they protected.  Their first confrontations with the Jedi Knights took the Mandalorians by surprise: their use of the Force, and the powers it granted them, was a challenge that they had never yet encountered. Such was the nature of the Mandalorians that they refused to let this stop them. The result was a major advancement in the developpement of Mandalorian technology, specifically of their weapons arsenal and their infamous armor. They also developped a fighting style that combined their entire arsenal to allow them to counter the Jedi's supernatural abilities.  With these new technologies and weaponries, the Mandalorians took the Jedi by surprise and developped a reputation of beinge able to confront and even defeat their Knights. The Jedi and the Mandalorians developped a famous enmity that lasted for several wars, and was remembered by the wider galaxy even millennia later, during the Clone Wars.</p>
